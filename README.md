# Arctic-Explorer

## NOTE: This was one of my first projects I worked on. The code in this repo is not representative of the quality, organization, or style with which I currently write code. 

This is the repo for Ethan and Dylan's CS 5660 final project. The final tool can be accessed at [the project website](http://www.dylanwootton.com/Arctic-Explorer/) and the final video can be found at [the video website](http://www.dylanwootton.com/Arctic-Explorer/video.html).
