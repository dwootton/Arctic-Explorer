# Arctic-Explorer

## NOTE: This was one of my first projects I worked on. The code in this repo is not representative of the quality, organization, or style with which I currently write code. 

## I include this project in my portfolio due to the documented process and wealth of well-designed interactions included in the tool itself. For a better idea of how I write code, see my [personal website](https://github.com/dwootton/dwootton.github.io). 


The final tool can be accessed at [the project website](http://www.dylanwootton.com/Arctic-Explorer/) and the final video can be found at [the video website](http://www.dylanwootton.com/Arctic-Explorer/video.html).
